        </h5>
        <h5 class='quote hide' id='2'>People are not what they say but what they do; so judge them not from their words
          but
          from
          their actions.</h5>
        <h5 class='quote hide' id='3'>When someone hurts you, don't feel bad because it's a law of nature that the tree

        <h5 class='quote hide' id='4'>Take whatever you can from your life because when life starts taking from you, it
          takes even
          your last breath.</h5>
        <h5 class='quote hide' id='5'>In this world, people will always throw stones on the path of your success. It
          depends
          on what
          you make from them - a wall or a bridge.</h5>

          time.
        </h5>

          intelligently.
        </h5>
        <h5 class='quote hide' id='16'>It is not what you don't have that limits you; it is what you have but don't know
          how
          to use.

          person
          has a
          price while the honest person has a value.</h5>
        <h5 class='quote hide' id='19'>If you succeed in cheating someone, don't think that the person is a fool......
          Realize that
          the person trusted you much more than you deserved.</h5>
